        <p>Hate to give the satisfaction, asking how you're doing now<br />
            How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?<br />
            Just what you wanted<br />
            Look at you, cool guy, you got it
        </p>
        <p>I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes<br />
            Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise<br />
            I loved you truly<br />
            Gotta laugh at the stupidity
        </p>
        <p>
            'Cause I've made some real big mistakes<br />
But you make the worst one look fine<br />
I should've known it was strange<br />
You only come out at night<br />
I used to think I was smart<br />
But you made me look so naive<br />
The way you sold me for parts<br />
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh<br />
Bloodsucker, famefucker<br />
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire
        </p>
        <p>
            And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news<br />
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too<br />
You're so convincing<br />
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)
        </p>
        <p>
            Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill<br />
Can't figure out just how you do it, and God knows I never will<br />
Went for me, and not her<br />
'Cause girls your age know better
        </p>
        <p>
            I've made some real big mistakes<br />
But you make the worst one look fine<br />
I should've known it was strange<br />
You only come out at night<br />
I used to think I was smart<br />
But you've made me look so naive<br />
The way you sold me for parts<br />
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh<br />
Bloodsucker, famefucker<br />
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire
        </p>
        <p>
            You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?<br />
You can't love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart<br />
I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't<br />
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand
        </p>
        <p>
            I've made some real big mistakes<br />
But you make the worst one look fine<br />
I should've known it was strange<br />
You only come out at night<br />
I used to think I was smart<br />
But you made me look so naive<br />
The way you sold me for parts<br />
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh<br />
Bloodsucker, famefucker<br />
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire
        </p>
