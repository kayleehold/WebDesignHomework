  <p id="textbodyslam">In this anime feature, 13-year-old Kiki moves to a seaside town with her talking cat, 
    Jiji, to spend a year alone, in accordance with her village's tradition for witches in training. 
    After learning to control her broomstick, Kiki sets up a flying courier service and soon becomes 
    a fixture in the community. But when the insecure young witch begins questioning herself and loses
 her magic abilities, she must overcome her self-doubt to get her powers back.</p>

<p>I am wrapped between two paragraph tags, so therefore I am a paragraph element.</p>
<p>I am another paragraph element.</p>



<p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of <b>lines</b>
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
</p>

<p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of <b>spaces</b>
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
</p>
<!-- You can see this below, where the first several paragraphs display as single lines. Using the line break, or the <br /> tag moves the cursor to the next line within the paragraph element. -->
<p>
    This paragraph contains many lines<br />
    made by using<br />
    the line break tag.
</p>

<!-- You can use the preformatted text element (<pre>...</pre>) to tell a browser to render spaces and text exactly as youâ€™ve typed. -->
<pre>
        This text contains several lines 
        in the source code.
     
             By using the preformatted 
                 text 
                    element, 
        it will look exactly as I have typed 
        it.
     
        This is mostly used for writing code,
     
     
              but we can also use it 
              for preformatted text, 
        too.
      </pre>

<!-- Horizontal rules cleanly create boundaries between content, and span the width of the page (or browser, if full width). -->

<p>This is a full paragraph about a topic of interest. It contains information specific to that interest, and will
    conclude that discussion.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is another paragraph, introducing a new topic. It can be separated from the previous using a horizontal line
    break.</p>


<!--     IMAGES -->
<!-- At this stage in your development journey, you can get an image to embed very similarly as you would in Markdown using the element <img src="..." />. -->

<p>This is how you would link to <a href="https://google.com">Google's Homepage</a>.</p>
